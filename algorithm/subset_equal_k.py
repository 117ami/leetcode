"""
Given a list (or set) arr and an integer n, find out where there is a 
subarray (not necessarily continuous) whose sum is exactly n ?
Example :  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 13
Output: true
There are multiple subarrays,[3, 4, 7], [6, 7], [1, 2, 3, 7], ...

This problem is NP-Complete, there is no known polynomial solution to this 
problem. A general way to deal with this type of problem is dynamic programming.

This method creates a 2D array of size (arr.size() + 1) * (target + 1) of type boolean. 
The state DP[i][j] is true if there exists a subset from A[0â€¦.i] with sum j. 
The new sum j + 1 is computed following:
1. if A[i] > j: dp[i][j] == dp[i-1][j]
2. else: dp[i][j] == dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j-A[i]]

Time complexity: n * sum
Space complexity: n * sum, or O(sum) if we use a single list
