# Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
#
# In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.
#
# You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
# Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
# Output: 9
# Explanation:
# Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
# Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
# 9 total points are earned.
# Note:
#
# The length of nums is at most 20000.
# Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].
#

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @return {Integer}
