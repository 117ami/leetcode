There was a massive V*^^&P*&^&N blocking since June 1, unfortunately, the server I sent you a few months ago was blocked. 
I've deployed a new one since then, you can scan the following QR code to decode the configurations.
If there is any problem, please feel free to drop me an email: ssruoz#gmail.com (change # to @)

P.S., You can also register one windscribe.com account as a backup xxx. It is free, you can get 20G quota per month.
