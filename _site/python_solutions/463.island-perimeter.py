#
# You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1
# represents land and 0 represents water.
# 
# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid
# is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one
# or more connected land cells).
# 
# The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the
# water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid
# is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of
# the island.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input:
# [[0,1,0,0],
# ⁠[1,1,1,0],
# ⁠[0,1,0,0],
# ⁠[1,1,0,0]]
# 
# Output: 16
# 
# Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
