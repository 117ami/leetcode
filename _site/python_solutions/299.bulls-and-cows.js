 * Testcase Example:  '"1807"\n"7810"'
 *
 * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You
 * write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each
 * time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many
 * digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and
 * position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but
 * locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use
 * successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
 * 
 * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and
 * friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows.Â 
 * 
 * Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate
 * digits.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
 * 
 * Output: "1A3B"
 * 
 * Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
 * 
 * Output: "1A1B"
 * 
 * Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a
 * cow.
 * 
 * Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only
 * contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.
