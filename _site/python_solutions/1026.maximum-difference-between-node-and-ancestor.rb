# Testcase Example:  '[8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there
# exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val|Â and A is an ancestor
# of B.
#
# (A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any
# child of A is an ancestor of B.)
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
# |8 - 3| = 5
# |3 - 7| = 4
# |8 - 1| = 7
# |10 - 13| = 3
# Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1|
# = 7.
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
# Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.
#
#
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode
#     attr_accessor :val, :left, :right
#     def initialize(val)
#         @val = val
#         @left, @right = nil, nil
#     end
# end

# @param {TreeNode} root
# @return {Integer}
