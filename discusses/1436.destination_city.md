The idea is simple: two sets `s, t` to cache source cities and destinations cities, then the difference of the two sets is the set of final-destinations cities.

### Rust Code
```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn dest_city(paths: Vec<Vec<String>>) -> String {
        let s: HashSet<String> = paths.iter().map(|v| v[0].clone()).collect();
        let t: HashSet<String> = paths.iter().map(|v| v[1].clone()).collect();
        t.difference(&s).collect::<Vec<&String>>()[0].to_string()
    }
}
```
