Basically, this is another variant of the [sliding window maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/) problem. 

The idea behind our solution is: we use `decreasing deque` to keep track of the previous `k` maximum sums. At each step of iterating over the array, we add the previous largest sum, which stored in `deque[0]`,  to current value `nums[i]` . At this time, there are two cases to consider: 

1. `nums[i] + deque[0] <= deque.last()`, then just append it to the deque ; 
2. `nums[i] + deque[0] > deque.last()`, first remove all items smaller than `nums[i] + deque[0]` from deque, then append current maximum sum to the end. 

Two details worth some elaboration: 

1. We do not store non-positive numbers into the `deque` since they are not improving our result, `max_sum + n <= max_sum` when `n <= 0`. 
2. In the 10-th line of the following code, we write `... d.back().unwrap() < &ns[i] ...` instead of `... d.back().unwrap() <= &ns[i] ... `, i.e., use `<` but not `<=`. This is because when the current value is `0` (assuming its index is `i`), we still need to append the current maximum sum `curmax_i = deque[0] + 0` to the deque, and thus when we meet some element with an index `i+k-1`, the previous maximum sum `curmax_i`, if it is still in the deque, is accessible.

### Rust Code 
```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn constrained_subset_sum(A: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> i32 {
        let mut ns = A.to_vec();
        let mut d: VecDeque<i32> = VecDeque::new();
        let mut res = ns[0];

        for i in (0..A.len()) {
            ns[i] += if d.is_empty() { 0 } else { d[0] };
            res = max(res, ns[i]);
            while !d.is_empty() && d.back().unwrap() < &ns[i] {
                d.pop_back();
            }
            if ns[i] > 0 {
                d.push_back(ns[i])
            };
            if i >= k as usize && !d.is_empty() && d[0] == ns[i - k as usize] {
                d.pop_front();
            }
        }
        res
    }
}
