## Idea
We keep a sliding window of substring consists of same character and sum up its accumulated length. When we meet a different character, the window shrinks into a single-char substring. 

## Complexity 
- Time `O(n)`
- Space `O(1)`


## C++ 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int countLetters(string S) {
    int res = 0, pre = 0;
    char pc = '#';
    for (char &c : S) {
      pre = c == pc ? pre + 1 : 1;
      res += pre;
      pc = c;
    }
    return res;
  }
};
```
