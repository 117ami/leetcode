## Idea
First, we congregate table by `spend_data`, `user_id` so we know what each user purchased on each date. This step is relatively easy with code shown as `with cte as ...` in the following solution. We get a result looks like:

```bash
+------------+---------+----------+
| spend_date | user_id | platform |
+------------+---------+----------+
| 2019-07-01 |       1 | both     |
| 2019-07-01 |       2 | mobile   |
| 2019-07-02 |       2 | mobile   |
| 2019-07-01 |       3 | desktop  |
| 2019-07-02 |       3 | desktop  |
+------------+---------+----------+
```

Notice that, date `2019-07-02` misses a `both` platform row. Since we want to figure out the consumptions for each platform (`desktop, mobile, both`) on each date, we first enumerate all possible combinations of `spend_date` x `platform` with a cross join of dates with platforms (as shown in `select DISTINCT spend_date ... (...) t`, and then join it with our `cte` table, generating the following result:

```bash
+------------+----------+-------------------------+---------+
| spend_date | platform | ifnull(total_amount, 0) | user_id |
+------------+----------+-------------------------+---------+
| 2019-07-01 | both     |                     200 |       1 |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   |                     100 |       2 |
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  |                     100 |       3 |
| 2019-07-02 | both     |                       0 |    NULL |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   |                     100 |       2 |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  |                     100 |       3 |
+------------+----------+-------------------------+---------+
```

The rest is simple, we congregate the table by `spend_date` and `platform`, and we get what we want.


## MySQL solution
```sql
WITH cte AS ( SELECT spend_date
    , user_id
    , ( CASE 
            WHEN count(platform) = 2 THEN 'both' 
            WHEN max(platform) = 'mobile' THEN 'mobile'
            ELSE 'desktop' 
        END ) AS platform
        , sum(amount) AS total_amount
FROM spending 
    GROUP BY spend_date, user_id
    ORDER BY spend_date ) 

SELECT t2.spend_date
    , t2.platform
    , sum( IFNULL (total_amount, 0)) AS total_amount
    , count(user_id) AS total_users

FROM (select DISTINCT spend_date
        , t.platform
    FROM cte CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 'desktop' AS platform union
        SELECT 'mobile' union
        SELECT 'both'
    ) t ) t2 
    LEFT JOIN cte ON t2.spend_date = cte.spend_date AND t2.platform = cte.platform
    GROUP BY t2.spend_date, t2.platform
```
