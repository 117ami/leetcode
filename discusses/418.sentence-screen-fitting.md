title: [Python] dictionary 

## Idea 
Brute force method iterates over each word and counts the times of fit until all rows have been consumed, this method will cause TLE. 
An improvement is to use a dictionary to keep track of how many words can be squeezed into a row if we start with a word `sentence[start]`, where `start` is the word index. With this idea, we can save lots of time and avoid TLE. 

## Python solution 
```python
class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
        cc = {}
        res, n = 0, len(sentence)
        for i in range(rows):
            start = res % n
            if start in cc:
                res += cc[start]
            else:
                cnt, j, i = 0, 0, start
                while j + len(sentence[i]) <= cols:
                    j += len(sentence[i]) + 1
                    i = (i + 1) % n
                    cnt += 1
                cc[start] = cnt
                res += cnt
        return res // n
```
