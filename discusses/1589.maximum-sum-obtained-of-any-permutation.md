## Idea 
1. Count the frequencies of each position, store results into `freq`
2. Reorder `num` such that the largest number in `nums` is assigned with the largest number in `freq`, the second largest in `nums`  is assigned with the second largest from `freq`, and so on.

The difficulty is: *how to efficiently calculate the frequencies of each position, i.e., the overlapping of lines*. Brute-force way takes time `O(n^2)` and causes TLE (go ahead and try it). 

### Efficiently calculate the frequencies
A better way is, for a given interval `[i, j]`, we 
1. increase the frequency of positions `i` by 1; 
2. decrease the frequency of positions `j+1` by 1, and delay the rest calculations to a later loop 
3. in the (later) loop over interval `[1, n-1]`, we keep a running sum. At current position `i`, the running sum is exactly the frequency the position i would have been visited.


## Complexity 
Time `O(n logn)`
Space `O(n)`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int maxSumRangeQuery(vector<int> &nums, vector<vector<int>> &requests) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> freq(n, 0);
    for (auto &r : requests) {
      freq[r[0]]++;
      if (r[1] < n - 1) freq[r[1] + 1]--;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
      freq[i] += freq[i - 1];

    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
    sort(freq.begin(), freq.end(), greater<int>());

    uint64_t res = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (freq[i] == 0)
        break;
      res = (res + freq[i] * nums[i]) % (1e9+7);
    }

    return res;
  }
};
```
