## Idea
Two conditions could be surely convenient for our method:
1. The values of `mat` are limited between 1 and 10000; 
2. `mat[i]` is sorted in strictly increasing order

We can build an array of size `10001` to count the occurrences of each element from `mat`, meanwhile we use an auxiliary `cnt` to keep track of the maximum occurrence. We then iterate over the array to search for the smallest common element.

## Complexity 
- Time `O(N)`, `N` is the size of `mat`
- Space `O(1)`. Note: if the upper bound of elements from `mat` is unlimited, we can not use this method.


## C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int smallestCommonElement(vector<vector<int>> &mat) {
    int cc[10001];
    memset(cc, 0, sizeof(cc));
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < mat.size(); i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < mat[i].size(); j++) {
        cc[mat[i][j]]++;
        cnt = max(cnt, cc[mat[i][j]]);
      }

    // Early stop. In this case, there is no element that occurs in each row.
    if(cnt < mat.size()) return -1; 
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10001; i++)
      if (cnt == cc[i])
        return i;
    return -1;
  }
};
```
