### Q: The idea behind ?
A brute-force idea will try all pairs `(i, j)` to find the minimum value `j-i` such that `i <= j && sum(a[i..j]) >= k`. This method has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. Apparently, we can do better than this. 

First, we use an auxiliary array `b` to store accumulated sums of `a`, i.e., `b[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]`, and an **increasing** deque `deq` to store indexes. By increasing we mean, for any two element `i1, i2 in deq`, if `i1 < i2`, then `b[i1] < b[i2]`.

The deque stores the possible values of the start pointer.

At step `i`, we keep shrinking the windows size to minimize our result `res` until `b[i] - b[j] < k`.


### Q: Time complexity ?
A: `O(n)`


### Q: Why `VecDeque`
A: we need to remove elements from both sides, using `VecDeque` perform these operations in constant time.

### Rust Code
```rust
use std::cmp::min;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

impl Solution {
    pub fn shortest_subarray(a: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> i32 {
        let n = a.len();
        let mut res = 1 + n;
        let mut b = vec![0; n + 1];
        for i in (1..n + 1) {
            b[i] = b[i - 1] + a[i - 1];
        }
        let mut d: VecDeque<usize> = VecDeque::new();

        for i in (0..n + 1) {
            while !d.is_empty() && b[i] - b[d[0]] >= k {
                res = min(res, i - d.pop_front().unwrap());
            }
            while !d.is_empty() && b[i] <= b[*(d.back().unwrap())] {
                d.pop_back();
            }
            d.push_back(i);
        }
        if res <= n { res as i32 } else { -1 }
    }
}
