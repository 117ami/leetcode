## Idea

Map each operand into an unique value, and then calculate the sum of each tree. Two trees are equivalent if and only if they have the same sum.

However, this tactic has a problem if we simply map `a` to 1, `b` to 2 and etc. It will consider two trees as equivalent
in cases when root1 is `a+d` and root2 is `b+c`. 

Then a (dirty) trick is using `Python` built-in `hash` function to map each operand into an unique unrelated value, and then calculate the sum. We call this trick "dirty" because, although it helps us to pass the OJ, it is essentially incorrect. We can not control the mapped value of `hash` and theoretically it is possible for two inequivalent trees to have the same sum.

```python
class Solution:
    def checkEquivalence(self, root1: 'Node', root2: 'Node') -> bool:
        def getSum(root):
            return hash(root.val) if root.val != '+' else getSum(
                root.left) + getSum(root.right)
        return getSum(root1) == getSum(root2)
```

## Complexity
- Time complexity `O(n)`
- Space `O(1)`
