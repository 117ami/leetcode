The key observation is that: **the sums of indices are identical for elements traversed along the same diagonal line**.

Take this matrix for example:

`nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`

1. `1 (0, 0) : 0 + 0 = 0`
2. `2 (0, 1), 4 (1, 0) : 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 == 1`
3. `3 (0, 2), 5 (1, 1), 7(2, 0): 0 + 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 0 = 1`
4. ...

Hence, the solution is kind of trivial: if we group all the elements with the **same sum of indices** into one container, and ordered them by their revered row id, the rest is straightforward. Specifically (with `Rust`):
1. Iterate over each row `nums[i]` of matrix, and put each element `nums[i][j]` into its corresponding group; 
2. Flatten the groups into a list. 

We use `HashMap<usize, VecDeque<i32>>` to store each group. We adopted `VecDeque<i32>` instead of `Vec<i32>`, this is because diagonals are from bottom to top, we can insert element into the container's front with `push_front()` method, which has amortized $$O(1)$$ time complexity.

### Rust
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

impl Solution {
    pub fn find_diagonal_order(nums: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> Vec<i32> {
        let mut cc: HashMap<usize, VecDeque<i32>> = HashMap::new();
        let mut maxlen = 0;
        for i in (0..nums.len()) {
            for j in (0..nums[i].len()) {
                if !cc.contains_key(&(i + j)) {
                    cc.insert(i + j, VecDeque::new());
                }
                cc.get_mut(&(i + j)).unwrap().push_front(nums[i][j]);
                maxlen = max(maxlen, i + j);
            }
        }
        (0..maxlen + 1)
            .map(|k| cc.get(&k).unwrap())
            .flatten()
            .map(|c| *c)
            .collect::<Vec<_>>()
    }
}
