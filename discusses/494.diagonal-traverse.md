The key observation is that: **the sums of indices are identical for elements traversed along the same diagonal line**.

Take this matrix for example:

`nums = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]`

1. `1 (0, 0) : 0 + 0 = 0`
2. `2 (0, 1), 4 (1, 0) : 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 == 1`
3. `3 (0, 2), 5 (1, 1), 7(2, 0): 0 + 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 0 = 1`
4. ...

Hence, the solution is kind of trivial: if we group all the elements with the **same sum of indices** into one container, and ordered them by **some order**, the rest is straightforward. Specifically we:
1. Iterate over each row `nums[i]` of matrix, and put each element `nums[i][j]` into its corresponding group; 
2. Flatten the groups into a list. 

The **some order** is determined by the index sum `i+j`. If `(i+j) % 2 == 0`, then the diagonal is from bottom to top. E.g., `7 -> 5 -> 3`, otherwise, it is from top to bottom.

We use `HashMap<usize, VecDeque<i32>>` to store each group. And we picked `VecDeque<i32>` instead of `Vec<i32>` as we can insert element into both sides with an amortized `O(1)` time complexity.

### Rust code
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::collections::VecDeque;

impl Solution {
    pub fn find_diagonal_order(matrix: Vec<Vec<i32>>) -> Vec<i32> {
        let m = matrix.len();
        if m == 0 {
            return vec![];
        };
        let n = matrix[0].len();
        let mut cc: Vec<VecDeque<i32>> = vec![VecDeque::new(); 2 * max(n, m)];

        for i in (0..m) {
            for j in (0..n) {
                if (i + j) % 2 == 1 {
                    cc[i + j].push_back(matrix[i][j]);
                } else {
                    cc[i + j].push_front(matrix[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        cc.iter().flatten().map(|c| *c).collect::<Vec<i32>>()
    }
}
```
