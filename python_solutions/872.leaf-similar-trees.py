#
# Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the
# values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
# 
# 
# 
# For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9,
# 8).
# 
# Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is
# the same.
# 
# Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and
# root2 are leaf-similar.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
