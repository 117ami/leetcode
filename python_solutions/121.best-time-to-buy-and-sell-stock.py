# Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given
# stock on day i.
#
# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one
# and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
# profit.
#
# Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-1 = 5.
# Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
#
#
