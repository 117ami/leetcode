# Testcase Example:  '[1,17,8]'
#
# Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for
# every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
#
# Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.Â  Two permutations
# A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] !=
# A2[i].
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [1,17,8]
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [2,2,2]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
#
# Note:
#
#
# 1 <= A.length <= 12
# 0 <= A[i] <= 1e9
#
