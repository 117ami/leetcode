 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4]'
 *
 * Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are
 * empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of
 * water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a
 * flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.
 *
 * Given an integer array rains where:
 *
 *
 * rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
 * rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake
 * this day and dry it.
 *
 *
 * Return an array ans where:
 *
 *
 * ans.length == rains.length
 * ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
 * ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith dayÂ if rains[i] == 0.
 *
 *
 * If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible
 * to avoid flood return an empty array.
 *
 * Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you
 * chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
 * Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
 * After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
 * After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
 * After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
 * There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
 * Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
 * Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
 * After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
 * After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
 * After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
 * After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
 * After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
 * It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another
 * acceptable scenario.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one
 * lake in the third day.
 * After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter
 * which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.
 *
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 *
 * Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
 * Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
 * Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1]
 * or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9
 *
 *
 * Example 5:
 *
 *
 * Input: rains = [10,20,20]
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no
 * chance to dry any lake.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= rains.length <= 10^5
 * 0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9
 *
