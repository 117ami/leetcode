#
# Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and
# subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The
# final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an
# integer, say 2, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has
# denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:"-1/2+1/2"
# Output: "0/1"
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
# Output: "1/3"
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input:"1/3-1/2"
# Output: "-1/6"
#
#
#
# Example 4:
#
# Input:"5/3+1/3"
# Output: "2/1"
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the
# output.
# Each fraction (input and output) has format Â±numerator/denominator. If the
# first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
# The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and
# denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the
# denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction
# format defined above.
# The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].
# The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid
# and in the range of 32-bit int.
