# Testcase Example:  '[5,3,2,4]'
#
# Given an array nums, you are allowed to choose one element of nums and change
# it by anyÂ value in one move.
#
# Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums
# after perfoming at most 3 moves.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2].
# The difference between the maximum and minimum is 2-2 = 0.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Change the array [1,5,0,10,14] to [1,1,0,1,1].
# The difference between the maximum and minimum is 1-0 = 1.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]
# Output: 2
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,5,6,14,15]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
#
