# Total Submissions: 447.8K
# Testcase Example:  '2\n[2,4,1]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the i-thÂ element is the price of a given
# stock on day i.
#
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k
# transactions.
#
# Note:
# You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must
# sell the stock before you buy again).
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit =
# 4-2 = 2.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-2 = 4.
# Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 =
# 3.
