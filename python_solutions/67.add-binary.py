#
# Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
# 
# The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 orÂ 0.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# Each string consists only of '0' or '1' characters.
# 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
# Each string is either "0" or doesn't contain any leading zero.
#
