# Testcase Example:  '1\n6\n3'
#
# You have d dice, and each die has f faces numbered 1, 2, ..., f.
#
# Return the number of possible ways (out of f^dÂ total ways) modulo 10^9 + 7 to
# roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals target.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
# 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of
# 10: 5+5.
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# You throw one die with 2 faces.  There is no way to get a sum of 3.
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
# Output: 222616187
# Explanation:
# The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= d, f <= 30
# 1 <= target <= 1000
#

                        n += dp[i - 1][j - k]
