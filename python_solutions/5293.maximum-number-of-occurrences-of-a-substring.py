#
# Given a string s, return the maximum number of ocurrences of any substring
# under the following rules:
#
#
# The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal
# to maxLetters.
# The substring size must be between minSize and maxSizeÂ inclusive.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Substring "aab" has 2 ocurrences in the original string.
# It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and
# maxSize).
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: s = "aabcabcab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 2, maxSize = 3
# Output: 3
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: s = "abcde", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= maxLetters <= 26
# 1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)
# s only contains lowercase English letters.
#
