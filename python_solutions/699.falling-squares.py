#
# On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they
# are given.
# 
# The i-th square dropped (positions[i] = (left, side_length)) is a square with
# the left-most point being positions[i][0] and sidelength positions[i][1].
# 
# The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and
# from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each
# square to stick before dropping the next.
# 
# The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed
# to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another
# square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together
# prematurely.
# 
# 
# Return a list ans of heights. Each height ans[i] represents the current
# highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares
# represented by positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i].
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]
# Output: [2, 5, 5]
# Explanation:
# 
# 
# After the first drop of positions[0] = [1, 2]: _aa _aa ------- The maximum
# height of any square is 2.
# 
# After the second drop of positions[1] = [2, 3]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa__ _aa__
# -------------- The maximum height of any square is 5. The larger square stays
# on top of the smaller square despite where its center of gravity is, because
# squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge.
# 
# After the third drop of positions[1] = [6, 1]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa _aa___a
# -------------- The maximum height of any square is still 5. Thus, we return
# an answer of [2, 5, 5].
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [[100, 100], [200, 100]]
# Output: [100, 100]
# Explanation: Adjacent squares don't get stuck prematurely - only their bottom
# edge can stick to surfaces.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= positions.length <= 1000.
# 1 <= positions[i][0] <= 10^8.
# 1 <= positions[i][1] <= 10^6.
