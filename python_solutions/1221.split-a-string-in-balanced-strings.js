 * Testcase Example:  '"RLRRLLRLRL"'
 *
 * Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R'
 * characters.
 * 
 * Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced
 * strings.
 * 
 * Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring
 * contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring
 * contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * s[i] = 'L' or 'R'
 *
