# 
# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
# tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between
# any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
# 
# 
# 
# Example:
# Given a binary tree 
# 
# ⁠         1
# ⁠        / \
# ⁠       2   3
# ⁠      / \     
# ⁠     4   5    
# 
# 
# 
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
# 
# 
# Note:
# The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
# between them.
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        self.res = 0
        def maxdepth(n):
            if not n: return 0
            l = maxdepth(n.left)
            r = maxdepth(n.right)
            self.res = max(self.res, l + r)
            return 1 + max(l, r)
        maxdepth(root)
        return self.res
