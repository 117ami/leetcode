# Testcase Example:  '"a0b1c2"'
#
# Given alphanumeric string s. (Alphanumeric string is a string consisting of
# lowercase English letters and digits).
#
# You have to find a permutation ofÂ the string where no letter is followed by
# another letter and no digit is followed by another digit. That is, no two
# adjacent characters have the same type.
#
# Return the reformatted string or return an empty string if it is impossible
# to reformat the string.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "a0b1c2"
# Output: "0a1b2c"
# Explanation: No two adjacent characters have the same type in "0a1b2c".
# "a0b1c2", "0a1b2c", "0c2a1b" are also valid permutations.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "leetcode"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "leetcode" has only characters so we cannot separate them by
# digits.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: s = "1229857369"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: "1229857369" has only digits so we cannot separate them by
# characters.
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: s = "covid2019"
# Output: "c2o0v1i9d"
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: s = "ab123"
# Output: "1a2b3"
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 500
# s consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.
#
#

    def reformat(self, s: str) -> str:

        # chars.append('')
        # nums.append('')
        res = zip(chars, nums + ['']) if len(chars) > len(nums) else zip(nums, chars + [""])
