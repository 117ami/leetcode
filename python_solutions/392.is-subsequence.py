# Testcase Example:  '"abc"\n"ahbgdc"'
#
# Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
# 
# A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original
# string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing
# the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a
# subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
# 
# Follow up:
# If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you
# want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario,
# how would you change your code?
# 
# Credits:
# Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test
# cases.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 100
# 0 <= t.length <= 10^4
# Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
#
