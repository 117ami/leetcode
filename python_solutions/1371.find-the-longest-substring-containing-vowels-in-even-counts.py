# Testcase Example:  '"eleetminicoworoep"'
#
# Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each
# vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must
# appear an even number of times.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
# Output: 13
# Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each
# of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "bcbcbc"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because
# all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
# sÂ contains only lowercase English letters.
#
