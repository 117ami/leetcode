 * algorithms
 * Easy (70.04%)
 * Total Accepted:    3.1K
 * Total Submissions: 4.4K
 * Testcase Example:  '"alice is a good girl she is a good
 * student"\n"a"\n"good"'
 *
 * Given words first and second, consider occurrences in someÂ text of the form
 * "first second third", where second comes immediately after first, and third
 * comes immediately after second.
 *
 * For each such occurrence, add "third" to the answer, and return the
 * answer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a",
 * second = "good"

 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= text.length <= 1000
 * text consists of space separated words, where each word consists of
 * lowercase English letters.
 * 1 <= first.length, second.length <= 10
 * first and second consist of lowercase English letters.
